# Learning Objectives

By the completion of this project, I am expected to have acquired the ability to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

## General
- Utilize arithmetic operators and comprehend their functionality.
- Apply logical operators (boolean operators) and understand their purpose.
- Understand the usage of relational operators and their significance in coding.
- Determine values considered TRUE and FALSE in the C programming language.
- Comprehend boolean operators and their role in programming.
- Implement conditional statements like `if` and `if ... else`.
- Enhance code readability through comments.
- Declare variables of different types, such as `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`.
- Assign values to variables.
- Print variable values using the `printf` function.
- Use `while` loops for iterative programming.
- Incorporate variables within `while` loops.
- Print variables using `printf`.
- Understand the ASCII character set.
- Grasp the purpose of the GCC flags `-m32` and `-m64`.

## Copyright - Plagiarism
- Emphasize the importance of originality and generating personal solutions.
- Avoid copying and pasting others' work.
- Refrain from publishing any project content.
- Recognize the consequences of plagiarism, including potential program removal.

## Requirements
- Utilize editors such as `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`.
- Compile code files on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the `gcc` compiler and specific flags.
- Conclude code files with a new line.
- Include a `README.md` file at the project's root directory.
- Avoid compilation errors and warnings.
- Prohibit the use of the `system` function.
- Adhere to the Betty style guidelines.
- Engage in quiz questions for the learning process.

## Tasks
- I was told to complete the following tasks:

### Task 1: Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- Write a program that assigns a random number to a variable named `n` and then prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Task 2: The last digit
- Create a program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` and then prints the last digit of the number.

### Task 3: alphABET
- Produce a program that prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by the uppercase alphabet, each in a separate line.

### Task 4: When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
- Develop a program that prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

### Task 5: Numbers
- Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers in base 10, starting from 0.

### Task 6: Numberz
- Craft a program that prints all single-digit numbers in base 10, starting from 0, using only the `putchar` function.

### Task 7: Smile in the mirror
- Create a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.

### Task 8: Hexadecimal
- Develop a program that prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

### Task 9: Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
- Design a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces.
