# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google. This is almost everything(summary) of what came with the project:

## General
- What is debugging
- What are some methods of debugging manually
- How to read the error messages

## Copyright - Plagiarism
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

## Tasks

### Task 0: Multiple mains
- Create a file named 0-main.c that tests the function positive_or_negative()
- You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
- You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.

### Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe
- Comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
- You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
- You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.

### Task 2: 0 > 972?
- Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
- Line count will not be checked for this task.

### Task 3: Leap year
- Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
- Line count will not be checked for this task.
- You can assume that all test cases have valid months and valid days, but not all month/day/year combinations are valid.
