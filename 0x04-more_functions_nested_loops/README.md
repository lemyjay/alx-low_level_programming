# Project: More Functions and Nested Loops

This project focuses on deepening your understanding of functions and nested loops in C programming. By completing the tasks, you'll reinforce your knowledge and practice writing efficient and clean code. The project also emphasizes adhering to coding standards, using proper function prototypes, and following good programming practices.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

### General
- Nested loops and their application.
- Functions: definition, declaration, and prototypes.
- Variable scope and its implications.
- Use of `gcc` flags: `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-pedantic`, `-Wextra`, `-std=gnu89`.
- Header files and their inclusion using `#include`.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

This project is meant to be completed independently. You are responsible for coming up with solutions to the provided tasks on your own. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited and will lead to removal from the program. Please respect the rules and integrity of the project.

## Requirements

### General
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Files must end with a newline character.
- A `README.md` file at the project's root is mandatory.
- Code must adhere to the Betty style guidelines.
- No use of global variables.
- Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Restricted use of standard library functions.
- `_putchar` can be used.
- The provided `_putchar.c` file will be used, no need to push it.
- Prototypes for functions, including `_putchar`, must be in `main.h`.
- Push the `main.h` file.
- Understanding of advanced concepts (e.g., call by reference, recursion, etc.) is not required.

## Tasks and Files

Task 0: isupper
Implement the function `_isupper(int c)` that checks for an uppercase character.
Ensure the prototype is included in the `main.h` header.
Compile the code using `gcc` with appropriate flags.

Task 1: isdigit
Implement the function `_isdigit(int c)` that checks for a digit.
Include the prototype in the `main.h` header.
Compile and test the code using `gcc`.

Task 2: Collaboration is multiplication
Write the function `mul(int a, int b)` to perform multiplication.
Include the prototype in `main.h`.
Compile and test the code.

Task 3: The numbers speak for themselves
Implement the function `print_numbers(void)` to print numbers from 0 to 9.
Usage of `_putchar` is limited to twice.
Compile and test the code.

Task 4: I believe in numbers and signs
Create the function `print_most_numbers(void)` to print numbers except 2 and 4.
Adhere to the `_putchar` restriction.
Compile and test the code.

Task 5: Numbers constitute the only universal language
Implement the function `more_numbers(void)` to print numbers 10 times from 0 to 14.
Stick to the `_putchar` limit.
Compile and test the code.

Task 6: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
Develop the function `print_line(int n)` to print a straight line of length `n`.
Follow the `_putchar` restriction.
Compile and test the code.

Task 7: I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
Write the function `print_diagonal(int n)` to print a diagonal line of length `n`.
Stick to the `_putchar` limit.
Compile and test the code.

Task 8: You are so much sunshine in every square inch
Implement the function `print_square(int size)` to print a square of size `size`.
Adhere to the `_putchar` and `#` character constraints.
Compile and test the code.

Task 9: Fizz-Buzz
Create a program to print numbers from 1 to 100 with specific conditions.
The standard library is allowed for this task.
Compile and run the program.

Task 10: Triangles
Develop the function `print_triangle(int size)` to print a triangle of size `size`.
Stick to the `_putchar` and `#` character constraints.
Compile and test the code.
